# Cloud Orchestrator

Tired of configuring cloud resources manually on each of your projects? To setup S3, Google Drive, Dropbox...

This project is for you! It aims to provide a simple API to rule them all, you will no longer need to worry about credentials, OAuth, configuration and so on. Just make a REST API call and you're done!
